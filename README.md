## How to Play

1. **Controls:**

     - Move Left: `A`
     - Move Right: `D`
     - Jump: `W`

     - Move Left: `Left Arrow`
     - Move Right: `Right Arrow`
     - Jump: `Up Arrow`
     - Attack: `Down Arrow`

2. **Gameplay:**

   - Players control their fighters to move, jump, and attack.
   - The health bars indicate the current health of each player.
   - Perform attacks when close to the opponent to reduce their health.
   - The game features attack animations, collision detection, and gravity effects.

3. **Winning:**
